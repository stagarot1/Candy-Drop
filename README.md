Candy Drop Game

Description
Candy Drop Merge is a browser-based puzzle game where players drop colorful candies into a grid and merge candies of the same type to score points. Inspired by two of my favorite games, this game aims to be a perfect mix between a classic merging game with Tetris-style mechanics.

Gameplay
Drop candies one by one.
When two candies of the same type touch vertically, they merge into a higher-level candy.
Earn points by merging candies â€” the higher the candy level, the more points awarded.
The game ends when a new candy cannot enter the top of the grid.

Features
Smooth candy dropping animation.
Random candy types with multiple levels.
Scoring system based on candy levels.
Merge mechanics for chain reactions.
Simple, colorful graphics.
